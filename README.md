Project Description:
This project involves building a glove that allows you to take photos simply by making the symbolic picture sign, by connecting each thumb to the opposite hand's index finger. Also, with different modes, you can select picture mode, video modes, and even activate other cameras in the nearby area.

To run:
1. Run the java distributed server on "unix4.andrew.cmu.edu" with port 5000.
2. Boot up each Raspberry Pi and use as directed.
